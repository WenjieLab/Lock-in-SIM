The Lock-in-SIM algorithm was developed primarily to ***eliminate background and enhance effective resolution in 2D-SIM imaging’***.<br/>

We offer three open-access Lock-in-SIM software platforms: ***MATLAB GUI, Fiji/ImageJ plugin, and an executable software*** version.<br/>

This is the first open-access algorithm compatible across these three platforms and the second Fiji/ImageJ plugin in 2D-SIM field.<br/>

***All standard raw 2D-SIM datasets (3 angles×3 phases×n frames) are supported*** for reconstruction.<br/>

To facilitate users of commercial SIM systems, we ***additionally provide a Fiji/ImageJ plugin for converting various SIM data sequences***, enabling seamless integration of our algorithm into commercial 2D-SIM data processing workflows.<br/>

Note that commercial SIM systems not based on standard SIM theory (3 angles×3 phases)—such as Zeiss Lattice-SIM, CrestOptics DeepSIM, and Visitech iSIM—are incompatible with our algorithm.<br/>

Running details of the code can be found in the "User guide.pdf" file.
