# Lock-in-SIM
The Lock-in-SIM algorithm was developed primarily to eliminate background and enhance effective resolution in 2D-SIM imaging. We offer three open-access Lock-in-SIM software platforms: MATLAB GUI, Fiji/ImageJ plugin, and an executable software version. This is the first open-access algorithm compatible across these three platforms and the second Fiji/ImageJ plugin in 2D-SIM field. All standard raw 2D-SIM datasets (3 angles×3 phases×n frames) are supported for reconstruction. To facilitate users of commercial SIM systems, we additionally provide a Fiji/ImageJ plugin for converting various SIM data sequences, enabling seamless integration of our algorithm into commercial 2D-SIM data processing workflows. Note that commercial SIM systems not based on standard SIM theory (3 angles×3 phases)—such as Zeiss Lattice-SIM, CrestOptics DeepSIM, and Visitech iSIM—are incompatible with our algorithm.


Methodological details of Lock-in-SIM can be found in our publication XXX (will be updated soon).

Running details of the code can be found in the "User guide.pdf" file.
